## README
### Playing around with the <canvas> html tag.

Currently, it does the following
* Draws concentric circles starting at the mouse coordinates of the click event
* X and Y input fields take positive or negative integers and offset the center of the circles drawn
* Color of each set of circles is semi-random; it's an hsv color with h determined by the x coordinate of the click event, s randomly, and v fixed.
